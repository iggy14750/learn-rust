Learning Rust
==============

Working through the Rust Book (first reference)
to learn the Rust programming language!
I had learned a lot of the ideas of Rust years ago,
but I could for-sure use some refresher and concrete usage.

I would love to be able to work with Rust, but even if I cannot,
I believe that I can learn many things from the language
which can inform my use of other languages, such as C++.


Procedure
---------

1. Install Rustup and broader Rust toolchain (Cargo, etc)

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Ideas
-----

1. Learn Rust, especially for embedded. Introduce to next employer.
2. Learn an RTOS (FreeRTOS?). Can I get Rust to work in it? There are some who have.
3. Rust + Teensy
4. Rust + RTOS + Teensy
5. Rust + RTOS + Teensy + Audio/DSP
6. Contribute to In-development ROTS in Rust
